To run the file -> sh ./Q3.sh

What my shell script is doing ? ->
Start
0) Shell operation  (a child process) is started
1) Result Directory is made (if not there)
2) Output.txt in Result Directory is created
3) while loop starts
4) It reads the input.txt file in parameters x, y, o (Operation) 
5) Then it itrerates over the if  else nested loops.
6) Nested ifs are here used to operate on x and y using the given Operation
7) Then the result is stored in a variable (Usinf nested ifs)
8) This variable is then echoed to the Output file (Output. txt) in the Result Directory (It's APPENDED)
9) While loop Ends if No more input to read
10) Shell Operation terminates
Done
